##   Issues and feedback  

Game Ranger/Steam online.
- You make new two folder Kenji DAT and Original DAT

- if you dropped because someone dont have dat file.

- if you want play kenji with your friends. send them from your DAT and it will not dropped.

- if you want original to play with ur friends. copy and paste it from ur Original DAT in BR file and it will not dropped.

- If Battle Realms say it can't open the ".dat" file after you copied the new one, make sure it is spelled exactly as the old one was...that is, "Battle Realms.dat".
Its better?
Its good balance
Fair play
